**Do the same for both addresses: old and new wallet**

Copy the signature completely, and paste it to email - reply with those informations:

---

1- the address from where the old coins will be send

2- the amount of coins

3- the TX id  of transaction

4- the signature from this address that you get from wallet
(see screenshots above for the "signature steps")

5- the address of the new wallet which will receive the coins
(from new wallet v4.0.0 https://github.com/SCRYT-COIN/scryt/releases/tag/v4.0.0)

6- the signature of this new address (again: see screenshots above for the"signature steps")


---


### Finally ###

Once we verify that both addresses belongs to the same person then we will do the swap and you will receive the new coins.
